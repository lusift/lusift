Using nav methods

## next
`Lusift.next()` progresses the guide to the next step

## prev
`Lusift.prev()` takes the guide to the previous step

## goto
`Lusift.goto(index: number)` sets the current step index to `index`

## close
`Lusift.close()` closes the active guide prematurely, without finishing it.

This method doesn't prevent lusift from checking for and displaying valid async steps, use `Lusift.disable()` in
conjuction for that.
