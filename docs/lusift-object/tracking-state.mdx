title: 'Tracking State'
description: Guide's tracking state
---

Tracking state of the guides is stored in the browser's localStorage, on key `lusift_state`.

`Lusift.getTrackingState()` retrieves the tracking state of *all* the guides saved by Lusift.

```typescript
type TrackingState = {
    [guideId: string]: GuideTrackingState;
}

type GuideTrackingState = {
    asyncSteps: {
        [stepId: number]: {
            toOpen: boolean;
        };
    };
    currentStepindex: number;
    enabled: boolean;
    finished: boolean;
    prematurelyClosed: boolean;
}
```

## asyncSteps
`asyncSteps` refers to hotspot steps with `async` set to `true`.

### toOpen
When `toOpen` is `true`, the hotspot will appear at the target dom element.

## currentStepindex
`currentStepindex` is the `index` of the currently displayed or to display step.

## enabled
Weather the guide is enabled.

## finished
`finished` is `true` when all of the sync steps have been closed.

## prematurelyClosed
`prematurelyClosed` is set to true when `Lusift.close()` is used to close the guide.
